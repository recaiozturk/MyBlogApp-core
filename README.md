# My Personal Portfolio Website

A dynamic and responsive portfolio website with admin panel. The backend is built with ASP.NET Core , the frontend with AJAX-jquery-Bootsrap, and the database with MSSQL-Code First.

My purpose in doing the project was to present to people my experiences and the projects I have done during my job search process.
